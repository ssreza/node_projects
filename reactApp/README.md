```sh
bower install --save react
```

And it's just as easy with [npm](http://npmjs.com):

```sh
npm i --save react
```



#### Build

Once you have the repository cloned, building a copy of `react.js` is really easy.

```sh
# grunt-cli is needed by grunt; you might have this installed already
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt build
```

At this point, you should now have a `build/` directory populated with everything you need to use React. The examples should all work.
